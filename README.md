# My Arch Linux Posinstall

Arch Linux with gnome is very good. So I save my configuration on the internet!
You can use this commands in your system, but don't forget, this is for gnome.
Somethings like drivers for chipset, gnome-tweaks configuration and a lot of things I didn't put it here. Why? Because I do this things 
manually. And finally, sorry if my english seems bad, i'm just a brazillian Arch Fan... or like the fandom says:


I use Arch BTW!
